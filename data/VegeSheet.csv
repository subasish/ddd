Minor Concrete Pavement| arkansas/california/connecticut/idaho/indiana/kentucky/texas| high|img2.png|Similar to minor concrete treatment, this measure is also applicable at the medians, gore areas and sign posts. The pavement can be colored or patterned during installation. One of the few disadvantages of this treatment is its high installation cost. 
Minor Concrete| arkansas/california/connecticut/idaho/indiana/kentucky/texas| moderate| img1.png|Minor concrete is one of the roadside design treatments for vegetation control. It is generally installed before construction of guardrails and beam barriers. Beyond the gore area, it can also be designed and installed at side slopes and sign posts. Minor concrete is available in variety of colors to match the color of soil and can be stamped with pattern for texture. <br>To design minor concrete, there are few base conditions to be checked. These are reinforcing fibers to be included, 28-day compressive strength to be tested and its thickness should be in between 2 inches to 3½ inches. There must be a blockout material installed under end treatments, of around 1½ inches to 3 inches in thickness. <br>There are several benefits and limitations attached to this treatment. It can be easily installed with standard equipment and life cycle cost is less if installed before the construction of guardrails and beam barriers. Limitations attached to minor concrete treatment are formation of leave-out section at guardrail system and it is not practical to install at an existing guardrail due to grading and excavation requirements. 
Asphalt Composite| california/kentucky/texas| low| img3.png|Asphalt composite is a vegetation control treatment wherein asphalt emulsion is sprayed and reinforced with fiberglass strands. This method eliminates weed penetration into the systems. One of the best advantages of using this treatment is its performance under existing guardrails. It can be used in situations where minor concrete treatment is not feasible. <br>This treatment is adherent to asphalt, concrete, wood and metal. To provide extra erosion protection, a coat of dilute emulsion and water is applied. One of the major advantages is low life cycle cost. In addition to that, this treatment can be simply and quickly installed at existing guardrails, easily repaired and allows minimal lane closure period. The limitation to this treatment is it cannot be installed at freezing climatic environment.
Stamped Asphalt Paving|| low| img4.png|Stamped asphalt paving is an economical alternative to other types of asphalt concretes. The pattern is formed by using standard compaction equipment which is pressed over the asphalt when it is warm. This process is repeated for the entire asphalt surface, and coloring is done as a final coat. <br>Stamped asphalt concrete can be used for aesthetic value like crosswalks, median strips and ramp locations. This treatment is not suitable for entire intersections. The design pattern for stamped asphalt is to use red color in herringbone pattern of 12” wide in a stamped course pattern. <br>Some of the benefits are use of variety of colors and patterns and installation is less labor intensive. Even though this treatment is quicker, there are several limitations to it. This process can only proceed if temperature is above 50 def. F within 8 hours of application and there is no precipitation expected. Asphalts may bleed through in hot climatic condition. The life cycle of this treatment is unknown.
Patterned Concrete Pavement|| high| img5.png|Patterned concrete pavement is imprinted with patterns before curing and then colored to increase aesthetic value. The design mix should adhere to “2010 Caltrans Standard Specification section 90-2, Minor Concrete.” As stamped asphalt paving, patterned concrete pavement also offers aesthetic value to roadside in addition to control vegetation. Main advantages of choosing concrete would be its “longevity, visual quality and context adaptability”. This treatment is more expensive and labor intensive than stamped asphalt, but it is better suited at some conditions like slopes. 
Rock Blanket| nevada/idaho/california| high| img6.png|A ground surface covered with rock cobbles at the roadside is the description of rock blanket treatment. It is a multi-purpose treatment which can be used for aesthetical value, erosion control or weed suppression. There are no typical locations for installations. Several locations can include embankment paving, slopes under bridges, drainage outlets and roundabout designs. <br>Rock blankets should not be placed near clear recovery zones or area near and at gore. The correct design specifications can lead to minimal maintenance for vegetation control. To increase the aesthetic value of the roadside, rock size should complement the plant material and geometric configurations of the roadway facility. The color of the rock also be considered to bring up the aesthetic value.  An important guideline to follow while placing the rock blanket would be to provide a physical barrier between the rock blanket and pedestrians or roadways. Physical barriers can include retaining walls, fences or concrete barriers. Some of the advantages of using rock are low maintenance cost, keeps weed out for a longer time and is wind resistant. 
Gravel Mulch| arizona/arkansas/connecticut/california/idaho/north dakota/nevada/vermont| low| img7.png|A mulch is applied to the surface of soil which helps in reduction of weed growth and enhancement of the aesthetic value. Gravel mulch, one of the mulching techniques, is the placement of graded crushed or quarried rock above a geo-synthetic fabric. This treatment can only be used where disruption from errant vehicles is unlikely. Use of 4 inches of minimum depth of gravel is required at control measures site. It is one of the least expensive control treatments that can be achieved with use of any existing equipment. One of the biggest limitations to this treatment is that it can be easily disrupted by errant vehicles. 
Aggregate Base| vermont/tennessee/arkansas| low| img8.png|A treatment appropriate for low traffic volume facilities, consists of compacted aggregate material to control roadside vegetation. This treatment should only contain aggregate and be free of organic matter and recycled asphalt. It is an easy to install, relocate and temporary measure. To extend the treatment’s effectiveness, compaction should be done on a regular basis. 
Rock Slope Protection| tennessee/texas/virginia/vermont| low| img9.png|Rock Slope Protection is a method to measure how root growth in plants are affected by rocks and soil on coastal slopes. The paper on rock slope talks about how roots are unpredictable and complex, and that there hasn’t been much technical research done on the topic. The paper suggests that the interconnectedness and depth of the root network among plants on coastal slopes is stable enough to be safe. Catallactic rock slopes are stable at lower angles but become unstable at higher angles. Rock slope protection can also be provided through single or double twist mesh. It would not unravel when wires are damaged because of double twist construction, which is considered as an advantage. Vegetation should not be placed directly on top of these areas, as it will have no effect. Surface vegetation will be able to protect loose rock structures from sea erosion and keep them from falling. The conclusion from this paper was that vegetation protection affects different types of rock formations on slopes differently.
Weed Control Mat (Fiber)| texas/nevada/kentucky/kansas/idaho/california| low|img10.png|Weed control fiber mats, composed of polyester fibers, work by blocking out sunlight so weeds die, but also having enough breathability so that water can get through and feed the plants. These mats need to be placed on a level surface without any debris. It has many advantages over other treatment methods because of its easy installation at existing and new roadside location. It is affordable, easily repairable and effective temporary measure. Based on the findings, one of the major limitations it possesses is that cannot be used in areas where it snows.  Washington State examined several weed barriers and found a need for annual cleaning to remove accumulation of organic/inorganic debris. Without this maintenance, the organic buildup starts to grow grass and weeds. Although prohibitively expensive for normal guardrail locations, on sites where herbicide use is restricted, weed barriers provide a viable option.
Herbicidal Geofabric| alabama| low| img11.png|This fabric provides a continuous barrier between the soil and the road. The fabric contains time sensitive herbicide that activates to prevent new roots of weeds from growing. Since this method uses herbicide, it is not recommended to be used in areas with slopes or runoffs, as the herbicide may contaminate nearby bodies of water.
Rubber Weed Mat| california/idaho/texas| low|img12.png|The rubber weed mat blocks out the sunlight and keeps root and plant growth at bay. The tiles are great for level areas but are not suited for inclines or declines. High winds and severe weather may displace the mats. The mats have to be sealed properly or else plants might grow in their groves. 
Irrigated Ornamental Vegetation| california/idaho/nevada|low|img13.jpg|The aim of this method is to avoid using tiles, mats, and other synthetically made barriers to prevent the spread of vegetation. This method aims to cover the ground with desirable vegetation that will not spread onto the roads and can suppress unwanted vegetation from growing. 
Native and Non-irrigated Vegetation| alabama/alaska/arizona/arkansas/california/colorado/connecticut/delaware/idaho/indiana/nevada|low|img14.jpg|Like the previous method, the aim of this method is to suppress unwanted vegetation, with the replacement of more desirable vegetation. This method involves placing vegetation that is native to a region, especially a rural region, near the roadside. The native vegetation will be well suited to the climate, and eventually will thrive on the side of the road, thus suffocating any weeds that may start to grow there.
Organic Mulch|alabama/alaska/arkansas/california/colorado/delaware/indiana/north dakota/nevada/rhode island/tennessee/texas/vermont|low|img15.png|This method is only effective temporarily. Since mulch is loose, it requires maintenance and replacement every 2-5 years. Organic mulches include grass clippings, wood chips or newspaper, providing thick layers of mulch help in control weed while it doesn’t interfere with plant growth. It is specified that 6 inches depth is required while providing organic mulches. This method should really only be used until another more permanent method can be put into place, or if the area using mulch will be worked on in the near future. If a project is being planned in an area that is using mulch to prevent the growth of weeds, then a temporary solution works fine because the area will need to be treated again following the project. Wood chip and bark mulch presents a costly alternative.
