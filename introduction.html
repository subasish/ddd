    <p> Department of Transportations (DOTs) have historically incorporated a range of roadside vegetation management techniques within the right of way (ROW) to maintain adequate sight distance, reduce invasive and nuisance weeds, provide roadside aesthetics, and protect roadway infrastructure and roadside appurtenances. Many of these are often included as part the respective agencyâ€™s Integrated Vegetation Management Plan. The most commonly used methods for vegetation control include mowing and other mechanical removal techniques, and chemical treatments such as herbicides. DOTs seek more permanent vegetation control (PVC) methods (at least 3 to 5 years) that are effective and economical to reduce the need for routine chemical and mechanical vegetation controls. This action may help DOTs reduce recurring maintenance costs, maintenance personnel exposure chemical treatments and traffic, and maintenance-related delays to the traveling public. The PVC measures can be categorized into three basic strategies that include impervious surfaces, pervious surfaces, and select vegetation establishment. This online selection tool will assist design and maintenance personnel in the selection of permanent vegetation controls for new construction and retrofit applications for various site specific roadside scenarios.</p>

    <h3>Treatment Selection</h3>

    <p>There are numerous considerations in choosing a PVC treatment. Each site has specific needs that include the cost of initial installation, maintenance and repair.  Other considerations are the overall life-cycle cost, suitability as new construction or retrofit,  and effective longevity. The ease of iinstallation, maintenance and repair is a prime consideration for worker exposure to traffic and other roadside hazards. The site location and context may be a factor in choosing a PVC. Considerations include whether the site is urban, suburban or rural and the adjacent land use such as residential, commercial, industrial or agricultural.</p>

    <h3>Relative Initial Cost and Life-Cycle</h3>

    <p>The cost for for each PVC is determined as it relates to each of the other treatment provided. A high initial installation cost needs to be weighed against a low life-cycle cost and low maintenance needs.</p>

    <h3>Advantages/Limitations/Common Problems</h3>

    <p>The information sheets provided will list the advantages, limitations and common problems of each of the PVC trreatments. These may be considerations such as installation uses typical maintenance equipment/practices or requires a leave out at ground penetrations. Common problems may be displacement by errant vehicles and maintenance equipment.</p>
